# Bedrock Modular Shop GUI
This is a modular shop system that lets you set up the whole system by only editing the `config.js` file!
- This shop GUI will open when an NPC with the tag specified in the config file is hit by a player.
- The player can then browse through the categories and items. You can even set structures to sell items with enchantments, lore or other specific parameters.
